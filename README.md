# The Odin Project sign-up page

In this project I was trying to emulate the style and layout of the example as shown below.

![The Odin Project sign up form](./img/sign-up-form.png)

Most of my time was spent on styling the form. I used some custom properties, pseudo-selectors, attribute selectors, and a different way to add JavaScript functions (which I'm not sure if I like :sweat_smile: )

I obviously didn't do a 1:1 replication of the example. I wanted a different color palette and kept it on the same theme of "Rock Lord culty weirdness" as the previous TOP land page project.
